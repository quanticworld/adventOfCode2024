## Special thanks to E. Wastl 

Thank you bro, with AoC every december is like a box of chocolates ! 

## My simple stupid approach of these challenges

As a father, time is rare and precious ^^. Thus, my code is not supposed to be prod ready

- [x] No tests (this is one shot...it's make or break! I just start by copying the sample in my data.txt file, and if it's ok, I replace the sample by my generated series)
- [x] No time for crystal clear variable names. Listen, I already don't have time to write clean code, do you really expect me to get back to my code later ?
- [x] Python rules the world. Although I'm a C# / Java / Kotlin developer, I really enjoy cheating on my daily languages with my old nightly lovely Python language
